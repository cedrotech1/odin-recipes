Recipe Project

This project is a simple recipe website created using only HTML. It serves as an introduction to web development using the basics of HTML markup. The website includes a collection of recipes presented in a user-friendly format.

Key Features:
- HTML structure: The project utilizes HTML tags to structure the content of the recipe website, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- Recipe pages: Each recipe has its own dedicated page with detailed instructions and ingredients.
- Navigation: The website includes a navigation menu that allows users to easily browse through different recipes.
- Image integration: The project incorporates images of the prepared dishes to enhance the visual appeal of the recipes.


This project provides a foundation for further development and can be expanded upon by incorporating additional technologies like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity in next weeks if posible in weekly projects!!.
